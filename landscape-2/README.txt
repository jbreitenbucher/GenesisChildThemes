SLIDESHOW
The slideshow that is underneath the header is using the WP-Cycle plugin which has been provided in the landscape/plugins/ folder. Upload the wp-cycle folder via FTP to your wp-content/plugins/ directory and then activate it. You will also need to configure the plugin by going to the Plugins > WP-Cycle page in your dashboard.

FEATURED IMAGES
By default WordPress will create a default thumbnail image for each image you upload and the size can be specified in your dashboard under Settings > Media. In addition, the Landscape child theme creates the following thumbnail images you'll see below, which are defined (and can be modified) in the functions.php file. These are the recommended thumbnail sizes that are used on the Landscape child theme demo site.
