Bones for Genesis
Author: Eddie Machado

This child theme is meant to make development easier & take
advantage of modern web development & design techniques.

It's meant for people who make custom child theme for the 
Genesis Framework: (http://themble.com/genesis).

You are free to create child themes for sale if you like, just
don't resell the exact same files for like $4, that would suck.

For more information, please visit:
