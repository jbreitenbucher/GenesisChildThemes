Stylesheet: IE Stylesheet

So instead of using the respond.js file to add media query support
to IE, we're going to use LESS to create an easily readable css file.
Here, we import all the styles the standard stylesheet gets, only
without the media queries. No need to worry about editing anything!

******************************************************************/

/*
All we have to do here is call in our stylesheets and that's it.
No need to worry about how IE will react with media queries 
because this page is media query free! Pretty awesome.
*/

/*********************
IMPORTING STYLES
*********************/

@import "normalize.less";
@import "mixins.less";
@import "base.less";
@import "600up.less";
@import "960up.less";
/* 
you can call the larger styles if you want, but there's really no need 
*/


/******************************************************************
ADDITIONAL IE FIXES
These fixes are now ONLY seen by IE, so you don't have to worry
about using prefixes, although it's best practice. For more info
on using Modernizr classes, check out this link:

/*
For example, you can use something like:

.no-textshadow .class { ... }
